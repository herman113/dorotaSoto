For many of us, holiday meals represent an either/or:  Either you go entirely off the rails or battle constant denial.  


What if you could just focus on what you love: taking time to enjoy friends and family, recharge, and share delicious food.  The holidays don't need to be a battle against your health and wellness goals.  


In this workshop, presented by Leia Desousa, we'll explore your specific holiday challenges and develop targeted strategies for navigating them. Then we'll practice using these strategies with a delicious and healthy meal.


You'll learn the perfect, satisfying portions of a balanced Thanksgiving meal, complete with a mocktail, a glass of wine and dessert (Vegans welcome!).
You'll leave with a refreshed attitude, smart goals and a practical game plan -- as well healthy recipes fit for the most decadent holiday table. 


Let's align our aspirational selves with our family tables.  Join us!
